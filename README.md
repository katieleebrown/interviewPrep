# Interview Prep React App
This is a react app I created to help with interview prep for fullstack developers. It includes questions for HTML, CSS, JS, and the MERN stack. 

# How It's Made
This app was spun up with Vite and built using React, JS, and CSS. While base version of this app was created as a frontend only project, it will soon expand to include not only a fully functional backend that stores interview questions, but also the ability to log in and create your own deck (you can use my deck or create your own answers to our large list of interview questions!). 

# Install
'npm install'

# Edit
Your interview questions can be changed by opening the 'questions.js' file in the src folder and following the existing syntax.

# Run 
'npm run dev'
